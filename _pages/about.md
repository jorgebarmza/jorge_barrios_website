Hello there 👋🏼 I'm Jorge <span style="color:grey">(pronounced HOR-heh)</span> 

I work at <a href='https://labs.google/'>Google Labs</a>, building new GenAI tools for creators. I'm a generalist SWE 👨🏻‍💻 with a deep interest in ML-powered language applications. My favorite thing in the world is collaborating to build products that bring people joy.

For recreation 🌈 I run trails, study math, share stories with friends, and appreciate each breath.
